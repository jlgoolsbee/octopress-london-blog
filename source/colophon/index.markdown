## Development

The site is "powered by <a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank">Octopress</a>", but it's not the only software that has contributed to the development of this site.  Also worth mentioning are:

* **<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>** - I pretty much exclusively use Sublime for coding these days; I'm seldom happy with anything else when I need to do complex operations, and it excels at almost anything I throw at it.
* **<a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/" target="_blank">Pixelmator</a>** - There's not a whole lot of graphics on this site, but when I need to edit something, Pixelmator almost always gets the job done.
* **<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>** - I keep the site's source on Github for a multitude of reasons, most of which are probably obvious to anybody that got this far.

## Writing

For writing, my wife and I author our posts with <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> in <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> on our Macs and iOS devices, and we save our drafts to a shared <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> folder.

## Hosting

The site is hosted on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a>, with whom I've been a happy customer for many years now.  It's also cached by <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> for maximum availability.
