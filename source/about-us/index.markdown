Hey there. My name is Lee, my wife's name is Stephanie, and we're glad you've found our little corner of the web.

In the spring of 2012, I was presented the opportunity to take a position in my company's London office. What you'll find here is a record of our experience, as best we can document it. Blog posts, pages, tips, cultural nuances... we'll do our best to catalog (or catalogue?) things, and we'll try to just be "real" about it. We're not doing this because we want attention and we're not interested in starting a new forum for US->UK expats... that said, we would like it to be useful to others, and if you find it useful, let us know!
