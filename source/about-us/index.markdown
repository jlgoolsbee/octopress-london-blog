In the spring of 2012, Lee was presented the opportunity to take a position in his company's London office. What you'll find here is a record of our experiences, as best we can document them. Blog posts, pages, tips, cultural nuances... we'll do our best to catalog (or catalogue?) things, and we'll try to just be "real" about it. We've found other sites like this very useful in preparing ourselves for this adventure, and if possible we would like our experiences to be useful to others as well. If you find it useful or have any questions, let us know!
