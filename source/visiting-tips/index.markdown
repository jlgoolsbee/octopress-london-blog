---

This page started as a list we were building for Steph's parents when they were planning a trip to visit us here in London.  We started coming up with all these tips, and figured we should just share them here in a "living" format that we can update from time to time.  Hope you find it useful!  Let us know in the comments if you do, and also let us know if you think we got anything below incorrect – the views here are really just our own after being here for a couple months.

## Things you should bring

Depending on how long you're going to be here and what time of the year you'll be here for, this list of suggested things to bring could change, but we've tried to list just general items:

- A travel size umbrella
- Good walking shoes
- A thick fleece or sweater
- A rain jacket; something that – depending on the temperature – you can pair with the fleece or sweater

## Arriving at Heathrow

_We don't have any experience with any airport in the London area except Heathrow at the moment, so this section focuses only on that airport._

The terminal you fly into at [Heathrow][] will change depending on the airline you fly in on; in general, if you fly British Airways you'll pretty much always end up at Terminal 5, and any other airline will end up at one of the other terminals.  They've tried to split up terminals to match airline allegiances as much as possible (Delta is at Terminal 4; American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic are at Terminal 3; United, US Airways, and Continental are at Terminal 1), but as with all rules, there are occasionally exceptions.  Links between terminals are easy thanks to Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express, and the terminals have plenty of signage to help you get around.

### Trains

{% raw %}<a class="fancybox" href="/visiting-tips/heathrow-rail.png" title="Map of Heathrow-area train options."><img src="/visiting-tips/heathrow-rail.png" /></a>{% endraw %}

#### Heathrow Express

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-heathrowexpress.jpg %}

[Heathrow Express][] is a National Rail service that runs direct high-speed service between Heathrow Terminal 5, 1,2,3, and Paddington.  You won't be able to use your Oyster on Heathrow Express; this is a ticket-only service, and tickets aren't cheap.  More than likely, the only time you'll use Heathrow Express is to travel between Terminals 1,2,3 and 5 to get to/from Heathrow Connect.

#### Heathrow Connect

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-heathrowconnect.png %}

[Heathrow Connect][] is another National Rail service that runs between Heathrow Terminals 4 and 1,2,3, and Paddington, but it also stops at Hayes and Harlington, Southall, Hanwell, West Ealing, and Ealing Broadway in between.  This is one exception to being able to use your Oyster on National Rail; while technically you can travel on Heathrow Connect between Hayes and Harlington and Paddington on your Oyster, you can't travel between Heathrow and Hayes and Harlington on Oyster.  This means that you'll need to buy a ticket to travel on Heathrow Connect to get out of or into Heathrow, but if you're not travelling to Heathrow and want to use Heathrow Connect to travel exclusively between any of the other stations (like between Ealing Broadway and Paddington), your Oyster card will be valid for that journey.  You can change at Ealing Broadway for the Underground District and Central lines, and at Paddington for the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines.

#### Underground

The [Piccadilly line][] services all five terminals, but all trains don't travel to all terminals; typically a service towards Heathrow will be labeled "Terminal 1,2,3 and 4" or "Terminal 1,2,3 and 5", and this is just due to how the track is laid out.  Pretty much all trains leaving Heathrow will be a service towards Cockfosters, though if you're at Terminal 4 or 5, the train may stop at (and may still be labeled for) Terminals 1,2,3.  Your Oyster card (read more about that below) is valid for all journeys on the Underground, including all the Heathrow terminals on the Piccadilly line, making this one of the most cost-efficient ways to get to/from Heathrow.

### Taxis

Every terminal has a taxi rank where cabbies line up to pick up new fares, making getting a cab easy.  Just go to the front of the line, get in the car at the front, and let the cabbie know where you'd like to go.  If you have a lot of luggage, the cabbie may get out to help you; if so, don't feel obligated to tip him; more than likely he'll go ahead and add a couple pounds to the meter himself.

## Public Transit

London has fantastic public transit; some general knowledge about the system ahead of time can save you from scratching your head once you're here.

### Oyster card

{% img right /visiting-tips/oyster-card.jpg %}

Get an [Oyster card][].  An Oyster card is a PAYG (pay-as-you-go) RFID-enabled travel card used for traveling on London Underground, Overground, DLR, and some National Rail trains (depending on how far outside the city center you go), as well as London buses.  You can get one at almost any manned Underground station (including Heathrow).  They work on a PAYG system; you top up the card at any Oyster kiosk using cash or card, and scan your Oyster card when you enter and leave the Underground system, or when boarding a bus.  When you travel via the Underground or other National Rail services that use Oyster, the system tracks where you entered and where you exited, and charges you the best possible fare for the journey.  When you scan your Oyster card on a bus, you're just charged a flat rate.

If you've done any research on Oyster cards before traveling, you may have seen that you can order a "visitor" card that'll be delivered to you... my advice is not to bother with that.  The card isn't really special in any way; it's pretty much the same card you'd buy at a kiosk in London, except that you'll pay shipping and handling on top of the standard fees.  Just wait; buy it here.

### Basic terms/info to know

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-underground.png %}

#### [Underground or Tube][]

Refers to the oldest-of-its-kind-in-the-world traditional subway that operates both in tunnels under the city and above ground in some areas outside the city center.

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-overground.png %}

#### [Overground][]

Refers to a newer rail system built to compliment the Underground.  The Overground – as the name implies – travels on surface-level tracks, and serves some of the more suburban areas of London.

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-dlr.png %}

#### [Docklands Light Railway][]

Similar to the Overground, the DLR is an above-ground railway that services the Docklands area on the east side of London.  Notably, the DLR trains have no driver, and are all computer-controlled.

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-tramlink.png %}

#### [Tramlink][]

The Tramlink (or Croydon Tramlink) is an above-ground tram system in southern London.  Unlike other London rail-based transit systems, fares on Tramlink are a flat fee, like buses.

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-tfl.png %}

#### [TFL][]

TFL stands for "Transport for London", which is the governing body charged with running the various public transit systems in London.

{% img right /visiting-tips/logo-nationalrail.png %}

#### [National Rail][]

National Rail is pretty much any other passenger train that travels in or outside of London that isn't the Underground, Overground (though Overground is technically considered to be National Rail), or DLR.  There are several different companies that make up National Rail, and they vary in size from smaller local operators (like Heathrow Connect and Overground) to larger national carriers (like First Great Western and East Coast).

#### [Travel zones][]

London is split into nine zones numbered 1 through 9, with zone one comprising most of what could be considered "central London", and being numbered in rings expanding outward from there.  Travel in each zone is charged at a different rate on all the rail services, which can make calculating a fare for a specific journey that travels between zones tricky.  This is where Oyster cards come in handy.

#### [Buses][]

London's buses are perhaps the most iconic in the world, so you won't have any trouble finding one.  Most – if not all – have Oyster readers onboard, and they charge a flat rate, so you'll get more for your money the farther you travel.  Note that buses don't stop at every stop; you need to wave an approaching bus down if you want to board, and you need to use the "stop" buttons inside to signal to the driver that you want to get off at the next stop.  If neither of thess occurs as a bus approaches a given stop, the driver will happily skip it.  Pro tip: the double-decker buses are a great way to see and explore London; find a route that cuts through a part of town you want to see, board the front seats at the top (if you can), and see the sights.

#### [Taxis][]

There's not much you need to know about using London's taxis; just be sure you're getting into a black cab and nothing else unless you've ordered a car from a specific mini-cab service.  Mini-cab drivers aren't legally allowed to pick up fares off the street, but that doesn't stop them from trying.

## Phones

In Europe, people commonly travel from country to country, and there's not many – if any – Europe-level mobile carriers; all the carriers here operate at the country-level (just like the US, really).  Given this fact, the mobile landscape here is completely different, in that PAYG SIM cards with voice, texts, and data are available easily, and most importantly, cheaply!  This means if you're coming from the US and have an unlocked GSM phone (if it uses a SIM card or has a slot for one, it's GSM-capable), odds are you can just pick up a SIM here for so much cheaper than it would cost you to pay international roaming fees to your US carrier.  You do need to be sure of a couple things though:

* Your phone needs to be SIM-unlocked.  Check with your carrier on this.
* Your phone needs to be compatible with the GSM networks in Europe.  By far the most common GSM frequencies in Europe are 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, whereas in the US the most common are 850 MHz and 1900 MHz.  Check with your carrier and/or consult the manufacturer of your phone to see if your phone supports those frequencies.  Many popular phones built in recent years – such as the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5 – support all 4 GSM frequencies.

There are several major carriers in the UK ([O2][], [EE][]/[Orange][]/[T-Mobile][], [3][], [Vodafone][]); any of them would likely be a decent choice, but we only have experience with O2, so they're the only ones we can personally comment on.  Their signal quality isn't always the best, but their 3G coverage is widespread and is pretty decent speed-wise.

## Dining

Just a couple general tips here.

For one, meals are typically longer affairs than they are in the US.  There are a couple things that go along with this concerning restaurants:

- It's perhaps more common to order an appetizer, main course, and a maybe also a dessert, because the portion sizes for everything are more reasonably sized, and also because you're typically at the table longer.
- Given that meals at restaurants are expected to be longer and perhaps more social affairs, waiters and waitresses will tend to leave you alone unless you grab their attention.  This extends to getting the bill; at most restaurants, you'll need to ask for the bill when you want it.  This isn't seen as rude – as it might be in the US – rather, it seems more the opposite is true; that it would be rude for them to interrupt your conversation or bring you the bill before you've asked for it.

Second, employees at restaurants here are paid what they should be, not beneath minimum wage like they are in the US.  This means there's not as much of a tipping culture in the restaurants here (and this extends to many other areas).  If the service was excellent, tip your waiter/waitress something like 10% to the nearest pound; if not, don't feel bad about not tipping – you're not expected to.

## Money

The currency in the UK is pounds (also called pounds sterling and abbreviated with the "£" symbol), and decimal amounts are called pence (usually abbreviated with the lowercase letter "p").  How you pay for things in the UK is up to you, but it's a good idea to have some cash on hand even if you intend to use your US credit card (which you can do) as some shops don't take cards.

Magnetic-swipe cards exist here, but "[chip and pin][]" cards are much more commonly used.  They work much like debit card readers in the US except you insert your card and then type your pin – kinda like an ATM – as opposed to swiping.  You won't have one of these cards, so if/when a shop or restaurant asks you to insert your card, more than likely you can just insert your card into the reader as if it had a chip, and the reader will read the magnetic stripe instead; otherwise, look for a separate swipe area either on top or on the side of the reader..

## Miscellanous

- When crossing the street, don't needlessly wait for the walk signal; it's a sure sign of a tourist.  Pay attention to which direction traffic is travelling (may be left or right depending on if the street is one-way or not – and keep in mind the direction of travel is the reverse of what you're used to), and if the coast is clear, just go.  When in doubt, if others are doing it, you probably should too.
- On a related note, the traffic lights here work a little differently in that they will generally move back to yellow before turning green (instead of going straight from red to green), but that doesn't mean drivers will wait for the green, so keep that in mind when considering whether to cross or not.
