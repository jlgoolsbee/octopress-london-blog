This post is a bit delayed; I've been working on it since May and I just keep adding to it as things happen.

We had our second visitor in May. My parents came back in November, and we had a good time, but I don't think we had lived in London long enough to really know what we were doing. This time though, we'd lived in London for about 9 months and were much more effective tour guides. Lee's brother Andrew stayed with us for about a week and a half. We spent several days being tourists in London and got to visit some of the places we've skipped since moving here. We also rented a car and went to Canterbury and Dover for the day. Lee and Andrew even got to go to Paris for a few days. We had a really great time and I think Lee really enjoyed getting to spend some time with his brother.

We had semi-planned to take a trip back at some point this summer, and Lee was asked to be in a wedding that happened to be on the same weekend as my youngest sister Katie's graduation, so we decided it was a perfect time to go. My middle sister, Jessica, has since gotten engaged and they are getting married in August, and so I'll be heading back alone for a few days in August so I can be there for all the excitement!  However, our trip to Texas was great!  We got to spend some time with each of our families, see friends, go to a Ranger's game, and Lee spent a few days working in Austin and hanging out with his brother. I was also very glad I got to spend some time with Jessica before she gets married! I am so excited for her, but it is really hard to be so far away while they are dress shopping, and well, planning everything, since I would normally be able to be there for a lot of it.

The summer craziness is no where near over though. We arrived back on Sunday morning (June 16). Lee went back to work on Monday, and we tried to get back to normal as quickly as possible since another visitor was about to arrive! 

My whole family originally planned to visit London all together this summer, but between weddings, graduations, work, and school, that just wasn't going to happen. It looked like no one would come, so in a moment of genius, I suggested that my parents just send my sister Katie, thinking it would take some convincing. It didn't! She arrived the Wednesday after we got back to London, and spent a little over a week with us, and we had a blast! Lee worked while we ran all over London, then on Saturday we rented a car and he drove us all to Stonehenge, Bath, and Caerphilly Castle in Wales. On Sunday night, Katie and I headed to Paris. What an adventure that was! Amazingly, everything went smoothly (we didn't even get lost, which is impressive since we don't know a word of French!). Well, almost everything went smoothly. Katie got pick pocketed... They only took her wallet, which was an amazing blessing since all she needed to replace was her driver's license and debit card. Thankfully, her passport, phone, and camera were left untouched. I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to spend that time with my sister. She is awesome, and since she was about 10 when I moved out for college, my time with her in the last few years has been limited.

While Katie was with us, we had our first experience with British healthcare. On Saturday night, I started having severe stomach pains on my right side, nausea, etc. I don't think I have ever been in that much pain in my entire life. After several hours of sleeplessness for both Lee and I, we took a taxi to the hospital at about 3am. I don't really remember much of what happened at that point, because I was pretty much beside myself in pain. I do know that they originally diagnosed me with appendicitis, and were ready to take me to surgery without any further tests, but since it was 4am, they didn't. They did give me some pain killers and anti-nausea medicine and moved me to a holding area. And then a strange thing happened... my pain never returned, even after the painkillers had long worn off. When it became clear that it was not appendicitis, they didn't order any further tests (or really do anything), they just wanted to keep me for another night for observation even though I was showing no symptoms at all. It would take several hours for a doctor to come see me, since once had seen me first thing in the morning, and once a day is all you get? Since we had a flight to catch, and I seriously felt fine, I signed an "against medical advice" form and we left. I have had no other symptoms and its been a few weeks, so thats good? I really hate not knowing what it was, but I could not lay in the hospital bed any longer feeling perfectly normal, stressing myself and Lee out, and ruining our Paris plans. Katie was so understanding and kept telling me to stay if I needed to, but I just couldn't do it. I really took it easy in Paris and didn't push myself, and I felt nearly 100% normal by the time we got back.

Anyways, it's been a very busy summer so far, and it's not slowing down in the slightest...
