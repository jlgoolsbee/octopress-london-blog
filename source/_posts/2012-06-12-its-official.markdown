It's official. WE ARE MOVING TO LONDON!!

Last Sunday, Lee received his official offer letter from his company.  By that point, we had already evaluated everything, and had pretty much talked the situation to death, so it was kind of a no brainer.  Lee signed and returned the offer letter last Monday, so yeah, its pretty official.

Monday night, we spent a while on the computer, FaceTime-ing with our families, telling them all the good news. (!?!?!)  I think Lee and I both were in a little bit of a fog for most of last week. We have been talking about this possibility for so long now it seems, and then all of a sudden, it was official. I think it took several days for us to fully absorb the news. Thankfully, we already had a weekend in Corpus Christi planned, because I think we both needed the time to shut off our brains, and stop worrying about the mountain of things coming up that we have to do and just let ourselves absorb the excitement/anxiety.

Corpus Christi was a lot of fun. We spent a lot of time relaxing on the beach and sleeping, but we also got to do some fun things like the aquarium, a baseball game, and a visit to the USS Lexington. Overall, it was an excellent weekend away.  Neither of us really talked/worried/stressed about all we had to do for the whole time we were gone. And then, pretty much the moment we drove out of Corpus, the to-do lists started again.

We’ve started filling out paperwork from the lawyers handling our visas. Some of the questions they ask are quite thought provoking?  I’m not sure how everyone else handles their finances, but Lee and I both get paid, and from that amount, we pay our bills. I have no idea what portion of each of our paychecks are used to pay what parts of our living expenses. That is far too much math. Most of the rest of it seems pretty standard, but this is just the beginning.

I seriously can’t believe this is happening. I mean, who just moves to London? I’m feeling super blessed to have a husband who is just as crazy as I am and actually wants to do this and also that he has such an amazing job that has given us this opportunity.
