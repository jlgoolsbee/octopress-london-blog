That's right. Driving. 

We decided that it was time we attempted driving a car. (by we, I mean Lee...) And what an adventure that was. We picked up a car at Heathrow yesterday morning and headed west. 

Our first stop was Stonehenge. We spent maybe an hour walking around, listening to the audio guide, and taking pictures. I have to say, it was pretty neat to be somewhere like that, but we are going to need to go back when its a little warmer to truly enjoy it. It was **so** cold. The weather yesterday was a little overcast and sat right at freezing all day. It was also very windy and snowing? Not the kind of snow we are used to in Texas where it is very wet snow and everything is icy. The kind where there are flurries hitting you in the face all day long. Which is pretty but not super enjoyable when you are standing out in the open with nothing to protect you from the cold cold wind.

Our next stop was Old Sarum, which is the remains of an ancient castle and cathedral. The castle was demolished in the 1200's, but after some excavation in the early 1900's, most of the foundation and some wall remnants are visible.

After lunch, we decided to detour a little on our way to Bath to drive through Bradford on Avon, because I had seen some pictures, and it seemed like it would be a nice detour. The city was beautiful and very old, but that just meant that the roads were super narrow and confusing, and there were pedestrians everywhere, so that was an adventure.

After that, we headed on to Bath to go to the Roman Baths. We had every intention of arriving 30min-1hr before the gates closed, which would have still given us 1-2hrs to go through, but that definitely didn't happen. We didn't prepare enough for where we would need to go once we got into Bath though, and ended up driving around for forever and then once we finally got parked, we discovered that the "pay and display" parking machine only took coins and I was Â£2 short... so back in the car we went to find another lot. By the time that was all said and done, we arrived at the baths in time to have the door shut in our faces. Now, we were still a few minutes before closing, but the guard said that they were full and was turning all sorts of people away. Big fail on my part, but we moved on. We went to Bath Abbey and listened in on an orchestra rehearsal, and then walked around the city for a while before heading home.

Overall, it was a great day full of adventure. I am very glad we did it. I am also very glad we had the forethought to rent an automatic car. By and large, most cars here are manual, and while Lee and I both have learned how to drive a manual, it would have been a nightmare for our first attempt at driving in the UK. The road signs are completely different, not to mention the driving on the other side of the road, and the car. I think we will definitely do that again for another day or weekend trip somewhere, but we may put a little more planning into where exactly we need to be to save ourselves some stress and frustration.

Next time, we will also actually remember to get gas before getting back to the rental return. I definitely did some looking while we were on our way back and found out where we needed to go to get gas before dropping off the car, and then we completely forgot. The lady told us that if we had the time it was better to go fill it up ourselves, as they (the rental place) would charge us twice as much. We had time, so we left to go do that, following an employee's directions... and we got ridiculously lost. Thirty minutes later, we finally made it back, gas tank full, feeling a little defeated, but happy the ordeal was over.
