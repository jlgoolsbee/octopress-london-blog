Well, despite earlier indications to the contrary... Lee's contract wasn't extended for another 6 months/year. To say we are bummed is an understatement. 

That being said, we are also excited! We will be relocating back to Austin at the end of August. Once the decision to move back was final, we agreed the best thing to do was for me to fly to Austin for a few days to find us a place to live. I spent a week in Austin in early July finding and leasing us an apartment, setting up all our utilities, and getting my old job back! All things considered, it should be a fairly smooth move. 

Lee's brother came apartment hunting with me and helped me weed several complexes out, and then my mom came down for a couple days and helped me make a decision. I am not an excellent decision maker, especially when it is not just a decision for me. We also don't plan to move again until we buy a house, so I wanted to be sure we would be happy wherever we are until that time comes. I think we found a place that fit all of our criteria, so I'm getting a little excited to move in and see all of our stuff again (since most of it has been in storage for a year)! I am also very glad that I went when I did; I found very few apartment complexes in our target area that still had availability for the end of August! I guess that is a busy time! Small plus: I was in Austin for the 4th of July, so I was able to go hear my sister's choir sing at the Capitol, and go to the fireworks in downtown. 

_Warning! Begin rant…_

Traveling alone was a little strange. Lee and I have travelled so much in the last year and we've got a nice routine down, so it was a little weird to do it all by myself. Plus, I had to rent a car and stay in a hotel alone, which was strange. Everything went smoothly though... well, mostly. I will never ever (ever, ever, ever) fly into JFK from overseas again. We had to make a decision pretty fast – we had visitors arriving on July 11, making it a kind of now-or-never situation – so we booked my flight the day before I left, and JFK was the only route with seats left on both flights. 

At JFK, I had a nearly 2.5 hr layover and was pretty panicked the whole time I was there that I would miss my flight. I waited:

* 45 minutes in the "quick connections" line in immigration (I shudder to think what it would have been like in the normal line),

* 10 minutes to find my bag (which had been removed with all the others from my flight and placed in a remote corner of baggage claim),

* 10 minutes to "recheck" my bag, which really just meant I stuck in a pile with a bunch of others and hoped it made it,

* and 1+ hour waiting in the security line. 

If you are counting, that means less than 25 minutes to get from Terminal 4 to Terminal 2 (via bus!) and get on my flight. Thankfully, I made it (and so did my bag, amazingly), but it was a very stressful few hours. Once in Austin though, everything went very smoothly.

_... end rant._ 

We've had Lee's family in town for the last week and a half, which was a blast (another blog post to come), so we are just now starting to have time to figure everything out. It is going to be a crazy month, especially considering I will be making one more short trip back to the US for my little sister's wedding before we move!
