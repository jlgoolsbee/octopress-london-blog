Well, we've been here for right at two months. Its hard to believe. I've spent some time this week thinking about what I like here and what I miss about the US.

## What I miss

**Tex-Mex food of any kind.** I realized today that it has gotten so bad that Taco Bell sounds delicious. Tex-Mex was the food genre we ate most often in Austin, and so having none at all here is depressing. We went to Chipotle last weekend, and that seemed to cheer us both up a bit. It wasn't quite the same as Chipotle in the US, but it was still really good, and tasted close enough to make us both happy.

**My car, for two reasons.**

1. The ability to go easily pretty much wherever I want is something I won't take for granted again. Mostly I don't mind walking or taking public transit places, but... walking a long way with heavy things like groceries or cat litter isn't exactly fun. And people look at me weird when I use the rolling cart since I'm about 50 years younger than the rest of the people I've seen using them. I typically ignore them and do it anyway... 
1. It takes a lot more planning and time to go certain places. It may only be a couple miles away but it takes you at least a half-hour to get there by whatever combo of walking, bus, and tube you use. 

**I miss our family.** We were already living 3-ish hours away, but across the ocean with a 6 hour time difference makes things more complicated.

## What I like

**New experiences.** And finally starting to figure things out here. I've figured out the grocery stores I like, found new household and beauty products I like, and I'm actually enjoying cooking for the first time ever. I'm not a great cook by any means, and for the most part I'm not trying anything crazy, but having the time to actually cook dinner and sit down at the table to eat in the evenings is nice.

**The weather.** I know I'll probably be sick of it soon, and in some ways I already am. Drizzly days are starting to get on my nerves. Either rain or don't. However, fall and winter are my favorite seasons. I love bundling up in sweaters and scarves. Last winter in Austin, I think we had a total of like 2 days below freezing? It felt like it winter never came, and then suddenly it was hot again. While it doesn't get Texas hot here, there appear to actually be seasons and that's kind of fun.

**No full length mirror.** I've got a new confidence in my wardrobe because I have no idea what I look like and that has to be okay.

We haven't done near enough traveling in my opinion, but we have tried to see as much of London as possible on the weekends and we have a few other weekend trips in the works. Unfortunately, most of the last two weeks and weekends has been spent with me on the couch. I did something weird to my foot a few weeks back, and was having trouble doing much walking. It appears to be doing better, although I still don't think I'm back to 100% so I am still trying to take it easy and limit my walking. My parents will be here in two weeks, so I'm trying to make sure I'm 100% by then.

I ventured out for an afternoon last week and hit some fabric stores and got a few things. Last weekend, I made Lee some comfy lounge shorts. I actually bought the fabric to make some pants for myself, but there was plenty to do both, so I started with his; still haven't made mine yet though. I also bought some fabric and supplies to make a Kindle case. It is super cute! It's obviously my first attempt at something like this... my stitches aren't super straight... But it's cute and I like it.

Earlier this week, I decided that it was time to do some sightseeing on my own. I went down to Kew Gardens and spent a few hours wandering around. It really is a beautiful place. I really only saw a fraction of the grounds; I think Lee and I will be going back soon.

I'm not sure what we will be up to this weekend. Lee found a few Mexican/Tex-Mex places to try, as we are both craving it so much, so we may pick one of those to try. I'd like to get out and do something London-y. The last few weekends have been so low-key (which was definitely needed), but I am really looking forward to some time out and about with Lee.
