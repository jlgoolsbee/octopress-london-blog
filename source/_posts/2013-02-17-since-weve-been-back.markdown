We've had a few weeks to get back into a routine here, and we are back to normal I think. The first week or so we were back was mostly spent catching up on sleep, laundry, housework, and cat snuggle time.

I've started going to a Zumba class on Monday nights right down the street. It's kicking my butt, but its a lot of fun, even though I have zero rhythm or dancing ability, and I look like a total goof. :) 

We haven't done much in the way of travel or sightseeing since we've been back. Last weekend we spent some time at the British Museum. We've been there twice before, but it's free and huge, so we don't feel bad going for just a hour or two when we have some time and we still haven't seen nearly all of it.

I've never been very big into Valentine's Day, but I like how we celebrate. We got engaged on Feb 13, 2009, so since then we have gone out on a date on the 13th instead. Then on Valentine's Day, we just stay home and order a pizza and watch a movie. It's nice, and low-key, and we get to celebrate on a day that has a special meaning to us. Anyway, he took me to an Italian restaurant on the river. Nothing super fancy, but we did have a nice view while we ate. :)

This weekend we set out to be tourists for a little while. Yesterday, we went into central London and rode one of the "heritage routemaster" bus routes. Basically it is just one of the regular routes through central London, but some of the buses that run it are very very old, and it's a pretty cool/cheap way to see some sights. After that, we spent a few hours at the Tate Modern art museum. I don't think either of us have ever been huge museum people, especially art museums. We are, however, living in a place with so many cool (and FREE) museums, so we are trying to see as much as we can while we are here.

I am planning a few trips in the near future for us. I think the first weekend in March we are going to Ireland, and then at the beginning of April, Amsterdam. Very excited! I think we are also going to take a day trip next weekend. Maybe if it's still as beautiful as it is right now, we'll go to Stonehenge.

While we were home, Lee was finally able to get the camera he has had his eye on for quite a while. He is loving it, and taking some seriously awesome photos. It's also a lot more compact, so we have been cataloging more of our daily life, because I think we will both want to look back on that sort of thing some day.
