Things are finally starting to feel "real".  Getting the site launched was a bit cathartic for me (being a nerd and all), but it also made things more "real" since it was our way of telling our friends about the adventure we're about to take on.  We've put the next three months up on poster boards in our dining room with sticky notes all over the place denoting trips, appointments, deadlines – you name it, it's on the calendar, cause it's the only way we'll keep up with it.

Our biometrics appointments are next week, along with filing the last of our visa paperwork.  We actually have to file our visa paperwork before we leave in mid-July for our flat-hunting trip, which is a bit concerning since we'll obviously need our passports for that flight, and the space between our biometrics appointment and that flight is only 8 business days... the attorneys working on it seem to be "ok" with that time-line though, so there's nothing to do but trust them and try not to freak out.

The weekend after that we're offloading some of our furniture, and then we'll begin the packing in earnest with the space we'll be gaining from said offloaded furniture.  Andrew (my brother) just moved to Austin, so he dropped off a bunch of boxes the other day, and we still have several from when we moved into this apartment, but if you have some boxes you don't need, let us know!

In the middle of all this is July 4th and Steph's last day at work!  Steph couldn't be happier about the latter, and she's ready to have more time to work on all the logistical stuff we just haven't had time for yet.  For the 4th, we'll likely head down for the [Austin Symphony's concert at the Long Center][1]; we enjoyed it a couple years ago, but they didn't do it last year because of the drought.  Stupid drought.

I'm awkward at ending blog posts, so here's some pictures of our cats.
