This month overall has been pretty great! It's been a while since we've posted a non-trip-focused update on our lives, so here goes.

{% raw %}<a class="fancybox" href="/images/blog/2013-04-21-what-weve-been-up-to-lately/DSC01846.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/2013-04-21-what-weve-been-up-to-lately/thumbnails/DSC01846.jpg" class="right"/></a>{% endraw %}Easter weekend it was still cold and dreary here, but we went out on Saturday to Walthamstow Market on the east side of London because I had heard about good deals on fabric. The rumors were definitely true; most of the fabric I saw was for Â£1-2 per meter which is so much better than you can find just about anywhere else. For Easter, since we don't have a home church here, we set out for central London and went to St. Paul's Cathedral for a service and then stayed for an organ recital. The service was beautiful, if a little atypical for us. We tried to get a nice picture of us in our Easter finery when we got home, but the cats kept photobombing... so we embraced it.  

Last weekend, we spent Sunday at Kew Gardens. I have been a couple times before, but Lee never had. I bought a membership a few weeks ago hoping we would go a lot this summer. Believe it or not, the two of us only have to go twice to get our money's worth, and I foresee us visiting more often than that. Anyway, it was a beautiful day. We really just wandered around for a few hours and enjoyed the day.

This past weekend we decided to get out of London for a little while and took a train to Cambridge on Saturday morning. Cambridge is less than an hour away, and is truly a beautiful city. Unfortunately, we were apparently there during exams (April to June??), so most of the colleges were closed to visitors. A little disappointing, but we still had a great day! It was a little bit of a different approach for us; we went with no expectations or plans, and it turned out awesome. We were both about ready to head home, and as we were walking towards the train station, Lee spotted a park. We followed the lead of the tons of other people spread out across the park, and ended up laying in the grass just talking and relaxing. Of course, our day was not without its hiccups; we got back to the station to find out that all trains back to Kings Cross for the next several hours had been cancelled.  We ended up on a completely packed later train to somewhere on the outskirts of London and we took the tube from there. It all worked out, but it was an adventure getting home.

In other news, my mood has taken a big upswing. The funny thing is, I didn't even know how under a cloud I was. Before we moved here, our doctor told us that we may suffer some 'seasonal affect' (her words, not mine) because of the short days and general dreary-ness here during the winter. I definitely didn't think it was having much of an effect on me, but since the time change a few weeks ago, I have so much more energy and my mood is so much better! I am finding excuses to get out of the house a lot more, instead of finding excuses to stay in. Also, it helps that the weather is absolutely **beautiful**.

I've made a few shirts, and I'm working on a skirt right now. I'm having a lot of fun trying new things, and I think I'm getting a lot better! It has been really nice to really have time to cultivate a hobby, as I've never really had the time to do that before.

Overall, things here are going great! We are in the process of planning a few more weekend outings, as well as looking forward to having some visitors this summer. Lee's brother will be here for a week next month and that should be a lot of fun!
