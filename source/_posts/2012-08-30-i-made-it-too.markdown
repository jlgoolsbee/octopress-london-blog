I've been in London now for 4 full days (I'm not counting Sunday because I was in quite a sleep-deprived fog...) and its already been quite an adventure.

Last week, while Lee was here getting settled, I was back in Texas staying with my family getting some final things done there. My mom, sisters, and I headed down to Austin for a few days to finish loading everything in storage, cleaning our apartment, and getting the cats sent towards London. The bonus was that we got to spend a little time all together before I left.

My last week in the States was quite a whirlwind, but I managed to get everything done, and only had a few minor breakdowns. I felt pretty bad for the poor guy at AT&T who was on the receiving end of one of those breakdowns. Oh, and the lady on the AT&T customer service line. Sensing a pattern? Basically, AT&T was a pain in the rear. Or maybe we were a pain in the rear. Really, it was probably some of both. We were trying to keep our numbers and just switch our iPhones to pay-as-you-go. We have each had our phone numbers for years and years and didn't want to deal with that mess, plus we wanted to be able to use our phones when we come back for visits, etc. Everyone at AT&T seemed confident it could be done, but they were just all sure it was someone else who had to do it. After getting passed around all over creation, a woman at one of the stores was finally able to figure it out.

My flight left on Saturday afternoon. The whole experience went even smoother than I had hoped. It was only the second time I've ever flown by myself – the first was about 11 years ago and pre-911 and I'm pretty sure my dad met me at the gate after my 45 minute ride from Houston to Dallas. The international flight with 3 pretty sizable (and heavy) bags was a completely different animal. My bags were checked with no problem, I spent some time saying good-bye to everyone out in the terminal, then headed on through security.

It seriously couldn't have been easier. My gate was straight ahead when I got through security, and I got on the plane and found my seat and got settled pretty quickly. I even had a nice gentleman sitting on the end of my row who offered to put my bag in the overhead compartment – a huge help since I kind of loaded it down in an effort to fit more in my checked bags.  A cheesy chick-flick, several chapters of Harry Potter, a few hours of sleep, and a couple episodes of Big-Bang Theory later and we were touching down in London. Got through immigration, loaded my ridiculously heavy bags (like a pro) on a luggage cart, walked straight through customs, and there was Lee, waiting for me. 

The last few days have already been quite an adjustment. The time difference, for one, is kicking my butt. I really just need to force myself to get up at like 7am tomorrow and I think it will work itself out just fine. The other major thing for me right now is not having a car. Generally speaking, I really don't mind it since I don't really like driving anyway, and the public transit is so accessible here that it really isn't a problem to get anywhere we need go. We are just so used to getting in our cars, going everywhere we need to go, getting everything we need to get right then, and being able to carry it home with no problem. It is a bit different here; you can't carry everything at once. I think actually living here like that will be fine with me, but trying to buy housewares for our flat has proved a bit tricky. We didn't need any furniture (thankfully), but we had no pots and pans or any kitchen stuff really, and no comforter or pillows, or well, basically all we had was furniture and clothes. After 2 trips to IKEA, and a few smaller trips to stores in our area, we are pretty well set. Tomorrow I am planning a grocery trip run to get the basics, so I can start cooking instead of just re-heating.

We tried a Thai place last night ([@Thai][1]) that we will definitely be going back to. We also found a good fish and chips place ([Kerbisher & Malt][2]) close by. That was pretty interesting actually. When we were here last month, we wanted to have some good fish and chips. Lee did a little googling and found a well-liked place fairly close to our hotel in Hammersmith, so we tried it and it really was very good. Unfortunately, that is not very close to our flat, so we were thinking we would need to find another restaurant a bit closer. Last night after dinner, we walked across the street to catch the bus home and couldn't believe our eyes when we saw another Kerbisher & Malt right in front of us. Turns out they opened a second location a few weeks ago right around the corner from our flat. How convenient!

All in all, things are going well. We are getting settled, and now that nearly everything is put away, it is starting to feel more like home. Its definitely different - for example, it is currently 48° F. Which is just crazy – I wore a jacket and scarf today. Also, we don't have a dryer, so there is currently a giant drying rack covered in our clothes sitting in the living room. 

I am still just so excited that we have this opportunity and can't wait to see what all is in store for us here!
