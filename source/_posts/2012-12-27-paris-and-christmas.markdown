Well, we've officially had our first Christmas on our own. We had a really nice day, but we also really missed time with our families. 

We didn't really have much of a "traditional" Christmas.  We decided that instead of exchanging gifts with each other we would take an impromptu trip to Paris, so I started looking at prices last weekend and was able to get a pretty good deal on a hotel and flight, and we decided to go for it. 

Our flight left from Heathrow on Friday afternoon, and generally it is very easy for us to get to Heathrow because we live on the Heathrow Connect rail line.  However, there had been a fire in one of the signaling boxes for that line overnight, and so instead all trains (except Underground) to Heathrow were cancelled, so instead it was a bit of a nightmare.  Lee had trouble even getting home from work so we could leave, and ended up power walking the 20 minutes home from the tube stop semi-near us, so we could turn around and power walk another 10 minutes in another direction – with suitcases – so we could catch a bus that took us to a Tube station that would get us to Heathrow. It was fun.

Once we got to the airport, our trip was pretty much smooth sailing though. We landed in Paris on Friday evening with enough time to get checked into our hotel, grab a quick dinner, and stop at a French bakery for amazing desserts.

Saturday, we pretty much hit the ground running. It rained nearly all day, so we tried to pick places to visit that were mostly inside. We started with breakfast at a cafe near our hotel, and then headed to Notre Dame. We spent some time walking around inside and then climbed up the bell tower. It was an overcast day, but the views were still awesome. After we finished at Notre Dame, we started walking with really no direction. We decided on crepes, and then headed to the Musée National d'Art Moderne (National Museum of Modern Art) at the Centre Georges Pompidou. We spent several hours there before stopping to see the Eiffel Tower all lit up and grabbing another quick dinner.

Sunday was another long day. We took the opportunity to sleep in, so we didn't head out until late morning. Our first stop was the Arc de Triomphe. We climbed to the top – what an awesome view! Not just the views of Paris, but it is fascinating to watch the traffic driving around the very large roundabout that surrounds the Arc de Triomphe. There appear to be no rules – or even lane markings. After that, we made our way to the Lourve for a couple pictures and then went to the Musee d'Orsay for the afternoon. We thought about actually going to the Lourve for the afternoon, but it just felt too overwhelming. The Musee d'Orsay was worth the time (plus I got in for free for being an under 25 resident of the UK) and it was also a bit more our speed (not a huge museum and several recognizable works). We ended the night by going up to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Awesome.

Our flight on Monday wasn't until 6pm, so we had most of the day to do more sightseeing. We took the metro to Montmartre. Montmartre is set up on a hill in the northern part of the city and is known I guess as the artist-y area. There is a beautiful cathedral (Sacré-Cœur Basilica, or Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris), as well as a ton of artists set up painting, and some neat shops and cafes. We spent a few hours there before heading back to our hotel to pick up our bags and head for the airport.

Overall, it was a great trip and we were so glad we were able to go. Of course, as soon as we got back to London, things went downhill a little... Lee somehow managed to leave his iPad on the airplane. Luckily, we figured it out while we were still at the airport, so while I headed home to start on dinner, Lee stayed at the airport to try and get it back, and after a little over an hour of phone calls and talking to departure desk staff, they found the iPad on the plane (which thankfully hadn't gone anywhere) and brought it out to him.  Anyway, another hour or so later, and some fun getting home thanks to transport shutting down for Christmas, he made it home and we were able to have a nice Christmas Eve.

We made breakfast tacos(!) about noon, I made an apple pie (otherwise known as apple soup... my first attempt at a fruit pie ever, and it didn't turn out quite right...), and we basically just hung out in our pajamas. It was a perfect Christmas Day. We didn't exchange gifts with each other, so we only had a couple things to open that were sent from overseas. It really was just a low-key day, which was exactly what we needed. We listened to a lot of Christmas music and watched Elf, and it was just a good day. It was really hard for both of us to be away from our families on Christmas for the first time ever, but having to miss it because we get to live in London made it seem okay.

Not sure what is up next. I'm trying to pick a place for us to go ice skating outside this week. I have always wanted to do that, and this appears to be our opportunity. Lee is home until January 2 or 3 I think, so we still have almost another week of enjoying our lazy holiday.

We are also looking forward to our trip back to the states in January. We will be there January 15-31 and will spend some time in both DFW and Austin. It is going to be a great couple weeks. :)
