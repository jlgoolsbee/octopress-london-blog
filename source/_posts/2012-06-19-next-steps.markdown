I think it is finally starting to sink in that we are moving. And suddenly the amount of things we have to do is starting to hit me. I seriously hate packing. But here I am at work, wanting to go home and start packing so I can feel like I’m getting something done.

Lee turned in our visa paperwork today, so that’s a step in the right direction. I feel like, besides that, the only thing we’ve really done is make a ton and a half to-do lists and a giant calendar.  At least we are organized?

In our opinions, next steps are:

* book flights to London for the middle of next month for a flat hunting trip
* get rid of the furniture we don’t want to keep so we can having some areas to stack boxes, etc
* start to figure out what goes with us, what gets put in storage, and what we get rid of
* start packing
* tell the world we are moving. 

So far we've really done none of this. So there's that.

Also, I have just over 2 weeks of work left. Could not be more excited about that.
