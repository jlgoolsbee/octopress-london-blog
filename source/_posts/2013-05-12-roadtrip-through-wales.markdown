We picked up a car from Heathrow on Saturday morning and set out for Wales. I semi-planned the trip, but mostly I just picked a few things to see and figured we'd wing it. It was a really great weekend!

Our first stop was actually still in England. In my trip planning, I saw pictures of a castle right on our route, so we stopped at Beeston Castle and Woodland Park for an hour or so. It was a little hike up to the top of a hill where the old castle sat, but from there you could see for miles in every direction.

Next, we headed up to the northern coast of Wales to the walled town of Conwy and Conwy Castle. This was an awesome little town right on the water. We spent a while walking around the castle and then set off to explore the town. We did a little shopping and then walked the perimeter of the town on the wall. Very cool!

The hotel itself was fine; we were in the middle of nowhere, so we ate dinner at the pub onsite. After breakfast in the morning, we walked literally across the street to Swallow Falls. We had to pay £1.50 to get into this little section of the park, but it had awesome vantage points of the falls. We walked around for a little while before hitting the road for another full day. 

We got a small peek at the scenery for the day as we drove to Caernarfon Castle which is on the west coast of Wales. (Sensing a theme? I accidentally picked 4 castles for us to visit without realizing that is what I did...) Since it was a holiday weekend, they had a bunch of people dressed up in medieval clothing doing exhibitions. It was kind of goofy, but we had a good time exploring. What was neat about everywhere we went was that they didn't have a set path to them; we got to explore on our own through seriously old buildings, which was awesome.

We spent the next several hours winding our way through Snowdonia National Park, and then just basically drove south through the entire length of Wales. It was quite an adventure. Lee has pretty much mastered driving on the other side of the road, whereas I – with my terrible depth perception – sit in the passenger seat and silently meltdown because it feels like we are going to hit the brick walls and shrubs we are driving next to. That being said, we had a great time. Roadtrips have always been something we've enjoyed doing together, so we turned the music up and just had a fun day.

Sunday evening, before heading towards our hotel, we made our last stop at Carreg Cennen Castle. This was one that I randomly stumbled upon the night before we left. It's mostly just the remains of a castle sitting up on top of a hill, but still very cool.

This is when we had a big adventure. We looked at all possible routes to our B&B in Caerleon, and Google showed one that Apple maps didn't (and believe it or not, we usually prefer Apple maps for these road trips). It was through Brecon Beacons National Park, and looked like it would be scenic, so we took it. What we then experienced was 30-45 minutes of driving down private roads only wide enough for one car in most places. With sheep! Lots of sheep. At one point we chased a herd of 4 sheep all the way down a road because they couldn't find an open gate and wouldn't just get out of the way.  After all that, we reached a major thoroughfare that we took the rest of the way, but man, that first little section was quite an experience.

I found a gem of a B&B to stay at on Sunday; I found it on TripAdvisor, and Lee being the cynic he can be, thought there was no way the reviews (76 5-star reviews out of 77 reviews) were all true. He was wrong. The room was beautiful and clean, and the owners were super friendly – hug you when you walk into breakfast friendly. They also visited with us while we ate and shared other places in the UK we should visit. The only thing I'll do differently next time will be to avoid going on a bank holiday weekend, as the pubs surrounding our B&B were madhouses on Sunday night until late and all the restaurants closed early. Honestly, I really didn't know anything about Caerleon before we got there, but it turned out to be an old Roman town, complete with baths, an amphitheater, and barracks dating to around 75AD and all completely free to visit, so that's how we spent our Monday morning.

On our way back towards London, we stopped in Bath for a few hours. If you'll remember back to [the last time we rented a car][1], we got to Bath just in time to not be allowed into the baths. This time, we made it! We spent most of the afternoon in Bath; we had lunch, did a little shopping, and visited the baths before heading back to London to drop off the car.

All told we had an amazing – if not exhausting – weekend. Lee is already trying to figure out the next time we can rent a car!
