So, I think it is time that we start documenting this journey.  Obviously, publishing this anywhere right now is not an option, but at some point, maybe it will become appropriate to do so.

We might move to London. There I said it. As long as I refer to it as a ‘maybe’ that is ok, right? Lee has been sort of in talks with his company for a while now about us relocating to London temporarily. This is something we have always wanted to do, and at this point in our lives, it kind of feels like one of those ‘now-or-never’ situations. Once we have kids, and/or a house, and all the responsibilities that go with, it won’t really be an option. That being said, this is a possibility that we are very excited about, but we are also very scared/stressed/worried. Besides the fear of the unknown (moving across the world is scary!), up to this point, my biggest worry has been the timing. 

We are renting right now. Our lease is up on June 17. Do we sign a new short-term lease? Do we go month-to-month even though it will be very expensive? Is this even going to happen, and should we just go ahead and re-lease our apartment? Will by some miracle (because it really would be a miracle at this point) will everything fall into place real quick?

If you know me at all, you know that I like to know where I’m going and what I’m doing. I like to have a plan. Not knowing where we will be living in 2 months has basically been turning me into a basket case.

> Matthew 6:34 - Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

This verse has always had the ability to get to me when I just really need to hear it. When I need to stop worrying and relying on myself and lean on God because he has the plan. I don’t need to know what it is all at once, because He knows it and will lead me in the right direction.

Yesterday was one of those days where God just had to basically hit me in the head to prove his point. Worrying about what is going to happen next in our life is not productive. I need to rely on Him. This will all happen in His timing, not ours. He won’t leave us homeless.

We have to give a 60 day notice to our complex if we are moving out. By my calculations, 60 days would be next Monday. We hadn’t heard anything from our apartment complex at all, so I went down to the office yesterday afternoon. I apparently had the wrong date; 60 days would have been yesterday. Then something amazing happened. The leasing manager told me he had been out of town and they had gotten behind with the renewals. This means we were supposed to have our paperwork last week and we never got it. This means he couldn’t legally ask for a 60 days notice. Now, we only have to give a 30 day notice. That bought us a month for things to move forward, so we better know what decision to make. I walked back to our apartment in tears, because it truly hit me – we shouldn’t be worry about trivial things like the timing. If this is God’s plan for us, he will work it out – and it’s not up to us to know and understand every detail, just to trust where He is taking us. 

There was a second thing that happened last night that drove this point home for me. We went to our small group.  We’ve only been attending for a couple months and are just starting to form relationships with the other couples. We shared our situation and our struggles and worries. And one of the couples in the group basically offered us the use of their house because they will be away for the next several months. How serious they were or if that will even happen remain to be seen.  But to me, more than just their generous offer, the truth that hit me once again, is that God will provide. We are in His hands. And if He wants us to move to London, we will, and He will get us there in His time.

Lots to process. I’m just holding onto the fact that everything will be worked out. And trying not to get my hopes up too much.
