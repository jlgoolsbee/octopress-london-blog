Oops... definitely didn't mean to wait 3 weeks between posts.  We've had a few busy weeks! 

Three weekends ago, we had a fun Saturday of adventures. First, we went to a few outdoor markets. Shepherd's Bush market was our first stop - kinda small in my opinion, and yet at the same time, a bit overwhelming. There were a lot of people, a lot of interesting smells, and not much space for my personal bubble. :) We also went to the Portobello Road market. I think we both enjoyed that and will be going back because there was just so much to see. We didn't really buy anything - aside from a cute Oyster Card (transport card) holder for me and Belgian waffles - but it was fun to walk around and look at everything from antiques to food from all over the world to well, you name it. After that, we rented bikes and took a nice ride through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. We have wanted to try these Cycle Hire stations they have set up around the city and finally got our opportunity. If you are familiar with Car2Go or ZipCar, it is a similar concept. You pay small amount for an "access period" (i.e. £1 for 24hrs) and then you just pay for the time you actually use the bike for, and you can pick them up and drop them off at any station. It was pretty cool.

The following weekend we went to Leavesden Studios (Harry Potter Studio Tour). Pretty neat! They built a couple faux-soundstages next to where they filmed Harry Potter and set them up kinda like a museum, and it's full of a whole ton of sets and props. It was pretty interesting to see how much detail goes into movies – like the Harry Potter series – that you never even see. On Sunday, we tried a church in our area, and it was an adventure. It was a very small church – much smaller than the building would imply – and they were lacking a pastor and a worship team. The week we were there, both were borrowed from a nearby Korean congregation, and while the worship and message weren't out of the ordinary, it was only the second time for the pastor to give a sermon in English, which made it not the easiest to understand fully.  In all, it was a very nice service, although neither Lee nor I felt like it would be somewhere we could call home. We were at least 20 years under the median age, and well, I think the only people in our 20's at all and there didn't seem to be many options for plugging in.

This past weekend we took some time for more sightseeing. On Saturday, we went to the British Museum for a few hours. We were there for 2 or 3 hours and literally only made it through about 1/8 of the museum. It is seriously huge. We planned to try another church this Sunday, but we were completely blocked into our neighborhood by a half-marathon, so that didn't happen... Sunday afternoon though, Lee planned an outing for us and it actually went according to plan!! (That's a big deal because our "plans" tend to fail big time.) We walked around Chinatown and Trafalgar Square, and then spent a few hours at the London Transport Museum. What was amazing/thought provoking to me was the images and descriptions of the beginnings of the London Underground in the 1860's. Incredible. We then took the "Thames Clipper" which was an overall frustrating experience (they have some seriously incompetent employees...) and basically a waste of money, but it took us where we wanted to go, so I guess thats what matters. Then we walked across the Millennium Bridge and walked around St. Paul's Cathedral. Overall, an excellent weekend.

Lee's work is still going well. I think he is really liking it. As far as what I've been doing, the answer is... not much. That sounds terrible. I've been doing a few sewing projects, taking care of things around the flat, and basically figuring out my life here. I would like to find a job that I only have to do when its convenient. That sounds reasonable, huh? Since at this point we don't financially need me to have a job, and we want to have the flexibility that me not having a job provides, it has been a good thing. I am getting a little antsy to be doing something, but I'm still not quite sure what that something is. So there's that.

We are getting to see and experience so many things that we wouldn't ordinarily. I love the international-ness (for lack of a better word...) of this city. I love sitting on the Tube or walking down the street and hearing several different languages all at the same time.
