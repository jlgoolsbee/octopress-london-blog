This is quite a novel - I apologize. I had a lot to say... :)

My impressions so far:

- I think I will like taking public transit, once I figure it out. It will be great to just chill and read, etc instead of having to navigate. That brings me to...
- The roads here are crazy. They are very narrow, and while the cars are much smaller, I don't think I will ever want to attempt driving. Especially when you add in different road markings/signs, driving on the other side of the road, and pedestrians. There are lots of them and some of them seriously have no fear. Frightening at times. And they don't all follow the 'walk' signs or marked crosswalks. Plus I have really bad depth perception. I'm pretty sure it would just be a disaster.
- Lots of people smoke here. Not that we don't have our share of smokers in the US, it's just more prevalent it seems. Probably because there doesn't seem to be designated areas outside in which to smoke, so it just happens anywhere and everywhere. That will take some getting used to.
- While yes, the language is English, it is definitely a different English. I needed a band-aid this morning and had to google what the term for that would be before attempting to ask the hotel front desk. It's 'plaster' in case you were wondering. It will be a fun learning experience.
- So much walking. We planned (or we thought we did...) and brought comfortable shoes for walking. I'm not sure either of us were as prepared as we thought we were. I've been wearing my nice Clarks I bought when working in retail, and my feet are absolutely killing me. To the point that I may just go ahead and buy shoes while are here instead of waiting until we get home as planned. It is pretty bad.
- It is so humid. I am reliving my middle school days before I discovered the magic of the hair straightener. I'm pretty sure yesterday, that when Lee said that we should go back to the hotel to rest... it was mostly because he was tired of looking at my crazy hair. It was so bad. Today was much better - not so many random rain showers, but finding a straightener with a UK plug must happen soon.

Now that we are starting to get a feel for the area, I really do think we will like living here. Once we find a flat, I know that I will feel even better about that. We saw 4 flats today. None of them screamed "you should live here!" One of them was like "you could live here and be happy but it's not ideal." The others were more like "run away fast!!" We have 4 appointments to see several flats tomorrow and 1 more on Saturday. I am hoping we find something tomorrow and are able to cancel Saturday's appointment, because I didn't much like the guy that was helping us.

This afternoon after our last appointment, we explored a bit. We took the Tube back to Ealing Broadway (our target area) with the intention of visiting a few more letting agents. Once we got there, we both realized how exhausted we were and decided on Starbucks instead. We used the iPad and looked up some properties for the agents in the area. We only ended up booking one more appointment, but this was one of the ones I feel more confident about. The woman was very friendly and helpful and had 5-6 properties to show us which is awesome. 

After leaving Ealing, with no phone for direction help (dead battery on our one London phone), we randomly decided it was time to be tourists for a little while and go see some London-y sites. We stopped at the Westminster stop and were able to see Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, the London Eye, etc. I honestly think this, more than anything else we've done, helped it sink in the most. We are freaking moving to London. How cool is that?!

Because we were already feeling adventurous, we jumped on figuring this would get us where we needed to go (since our hotel is right down the block from the Hammersmith Underground), and we could see some more of London along the way. It was great! Took a bit longer than the Tube would have, but we got to see so many areas, and really just get more of a feel for the city. The line ended at the Tube station we've been using so it worked out perfectly.

I know at some point we will know what we are doing, but right now we both kind of feel like total noobs walking around. We are pretty clueless, despite the extensive research we did before coming, so that's fun. Of course, we have been asked for directions a few times and have been able to answer confidently 2 out of 3 times which was pretty cool. Maybe we don't look as clueless as we feel. Or maybe some people are just way more clueless than we are.

I agreed to Thai for dinner (if you know me and my ridiculous stomach, this is a huge deal). Definitely feeling adventurous today. It was actually really good, and so far, my tummy is happy, so overall an excellent day. Hoping tomorrow is the day. Need a place to live please.
