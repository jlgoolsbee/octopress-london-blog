The title says it all. We have been going non-stop in many different directions for a few weeks now. After we got home from Georgia, Lee finished up his last few weeks in the Austin office while I packed up most of our belongings, and took care of some other logistics.

Movers came on Thursday of last week and took all of our stuff to a storage space. We spent the next day and a half trying to pack our suitcases, mostly clean out our apartment, and trying to get the cat paperwork taken care of. We definitely had a few of those 'everything-that-could-go-wrong-did' moments. This included a trip back to the storage space to unpack and repack half of it to get some paperwork out that we forgot. Fun stuff.

We spent the weekend running around the Metroplex, tying up loose ends, and visiting with friends and family. Our biggest hurdle we still had to deal with was selling our car. We put it up on Craigslist on Sunday and despite the fact that it was an awesome car, we think it was too new for that type of market. Most people buying a year old car would rather just buy a brand new car. We kind of decided how much we would ideally (and pretty realistically) like to get for it, and were hoping that we would be able to get something close. We went to the bank this morning, and were totally discouraged with how complicated a sale to an individual would be since we will already be in London. We then took it to Carmax, just to see what they would give us. The whole time they were appraising our car, I sat and prayed that it would be just very evident to us what we were supposed to do. They came back with the offer and it was the exact amount we wanted. What an amazing blessing! We were able to sign everything and just walk away with our money. One less thing to take care of.

This afternoon, we dropped Lee off at the airport. I don't think in all of my thinking about the next week, I ever realized how hard this next week is going to be. From a logical standpoint, it makes sense. We have to stuff to set up there, stuff to close down here - lets divide and conquer. This is just going to be a very emotional week and I have to do it without hugs from my husband.

All that to say, we are getting close. Lee is on his way there. Our cats leave on Wednesday. I leave on Saturday. In less than a week, we will be settling in our new flat and I could not be more excited. Or freaked out.
