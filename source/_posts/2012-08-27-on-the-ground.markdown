Hello from London!  I landed Tuesday morning and things have been a whirlwind since; let's see how much I can remember (this may end up being a pretty long post; sorry in advance!)...

## Tuesday

{% raw %}<a class="fancybox" href="/images/blog/2012-08-27-on-the-ground/IMG_1252.JPG" title="Big plane."><img src="/images/blog/2012-08-27-on-the-ground/thumbnails/IMG_1252.JPG" class="right"/></a>{% endraw %}The flight from Dallas was an overnighter; I left DFW at 5:50pm CST and landed around 8:20am London time.  Terminal 5 is pretty big (has three concourses of its own), but it was pretty easy to navigate and within a half hour I had gone through immigration, cleared customs, and had collected my luggage (thank you Heathrow for the free luggage carts).  I took a cab to a B&B – [Ardmore House][1] – that we'd reserved ahead of time, knowing that I wouldn't be able to get the keys to the flat until Wednesday.  It was a nice place, and I'll be recommending it to friends and family that come to visit; the only snafu was with scheduling.  The owner was out, so the owner's daughter was running the show for a couple days, and somehow they'd double-booked both nights, so the first night I got upgraded to a double room with an en-suite bath, and the second night she was going to offer to put me up in another local B&B, but I ended up not needing it and just slept at our flat instead.  Anyways, after a trip into Hammersmith to pick up some mail from a coworker and a couple other miscellaneous errands, I went back to the B&B and took a much-longer-than-planned-but-necessary nap before a trip to IKEA for some "essentials" I'd need at the new flat, like a pillow and a set of bath towels.  Dinner was also had at IKEA, and I can report that the Swedish meatballs do in fact taste the same here as they do in the states.

## Wednesday

Flat check-in day!  Check-in was scheduled for 2pm, and I didn't really have anything else to do this day except haul my luggage from the B&B to the flat after check-in.  I'd ordered several things from Amazon UK to be delivered to the flat with the aim of having them delivered _after_ I'd received the keys... unfortunately, several of the deliveries were reported as being "on the truck for delivery" already, and so with some of those deliveries being valuable, not wanting to have to mess with re-delivery, and not really having anything else to do, I just sat outside the flat reading Harry Potter on my iPad until check-in.  This, while I'm sure looked somewhat odd, was not in vain as **all** of the package were delivered before check-in.

The guy doing the check-in showed up about 10 minutes till 2pm, and that whole process took about 30 minutes and afterwards I had the keys!  I spent the next hour or so shuttling luggage from the B&B to the flat, and then started unpacking.  The landlords left a bit more than I thought they were going to, but the great thing is that whatever we're not going to use we can just stick up in the loft.  I still have some things to learn about British appliances; I've no clue how to work the oven, the boiler (which blessedly doesn't require any fiddling to get hot water, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with all the controls as far as maintenance goes), the radiators (which again, blessedly, we don't need just yet) or the towel warmer.  Not having central air control is interesting; opening the windows is nice and we get pretty good airflow through the apartment if I open a front and rear window, but one thing I enjoy about A/C is the way it sucks the moisture out of the air; might need to pick up a dehumidifier at some point.

## Thursday

Thursday was a good introduction to the old British pastime: queuing.  The cats had shipped out Wednesday evening and arrived at Heathrow around 9am, and the guidance from everybody was that they'd be available for pickup 3-4 hours after landing, so I showed up around 11:45 and started waiting... and waiting... and waiting... and I didn't get the cats until about 4:30pm.  I'm told they were allowed out of their cages and were in a holding area of some kind (though I've no idea what kind of holding area), but that was certainly much longer than they (or I) were supposed to have to wait.  The best part was everybody blaming everybody else; the Heathrow "Animal Reception Centre" (ARC) – I think rightly – blamed PBS (the customs broker for United/Continental airlines), because PBS needed to supply ARC with the customs clearance.  Meanwhile, PBS blamed Defra (UK version of the USDA) for taking so long to process paperwork, and Defra denied that any such slowdown existed.  Thing is, I'm inclined to believe Defra, since several pet owners using other customs brokers came and went (and some quite quickly), and in the end every person stuck waiting there for hours on end (even some who had arrived before I did) was waiting for their customs clearance to be brokered by PBS.  Lesson learned: don't fly animals on United/Continental, and in fact, do fly animals on Virgin Atlantic, because they handle their own customs paperwork, making the process much more simple.  Anyways, with the cats finally in tow, I got a cab from the ARC and took the cats back to the flat.  They were in good spirits and have acclimated pretty quickly; they started using the litter box without issue (I bought a similar sized box and the same litter we were using the US, so I'm sure that helped), and they've been very happy to be back with someone they recognize.

## Friday & Saturday

Do-nothing days – finally!  Actually, this was planned; I wasn't ready to leave the cats totally unsupervised in the new flat, so I had planned to have a couple days where I'd help them learn their new home and do some "trial run" periods of being alone.  Friday was spent totally indoors, which I spent finishing the unpacking of my suitcases and finding places for all the things that were just laying around from the first couple days of low-key bachelor-style living.  Saturday I did more of the same, but snuck out to a Starbucks with some WiFi for a little bit to feed both of my addictions.  The cats did well while I was away, so we'll try more of these trips soon.

Steph would be arriving on Sunday, so I spent a few minutes the night before looking up the best transit options to get me to Heathrow on-time and then to get both of us back with her luggage... I spent about 10 minutes coming up with a "perfect" route plan, and then remembered the sign I'd seen at our local train station: "This station is closed on Sunday."  I'd seen it in passing a few days back and hadn't remembered until now, so back to the route planning I went – arduous as it was on my iPhone with just the 3G connection and not-so-great signal, but a few minutes later I had a good plan.

## SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY!

Steph's arrival day!  My good plan for the transit went swimmingly and I arrived at Heathrow about a half-hour before her flight touched down (I wanted to make sure I would be there if she landed early).  I knew I'd have a little while to wait – she needed to land firstly, then get through immigration, customs, and then get her baggage – before she'd exit the "Arrivals" doors, so I grabbed a muffin and some coffee and read more Harry Potter while I waited.  Her flight actually landed a little later than planned, but soon enough she walked through those doors with the biggest smile on her face and we totally had one of those me-lifting-her-off-the-ground-big-hug moments.  A short train and bus ride back to the flat, and we were home.

That's right; _home_ is now **London.**  Crazy.
