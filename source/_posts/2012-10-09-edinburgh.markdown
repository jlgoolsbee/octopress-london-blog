{% gmap "Edinburgh, Scotland" 8 right %}

We spent this past weekend in Edinburgh, Scotland. Judging on how smoothly our planned trips normally go, I was a little nervous - especially since I did pretty much all of the planning and reservations for this one without much input from Lee.

Friday afternoon, I met Lee at Kings Cross Station in London for our train out. I apparently misunderstood the train website. I made the reservations last week and was able to get reserved seats for the trip from Edinburgh to London, but not for the trip to Edinburgh. The way it was phrased, I took it to mean that they did not make reservations for that journey. I was wrong... They did take reservations, there just were none available. This didn't stop them from selling us a ticket or letting us on the train, it just meant we had no where to sit. We spent the ride from London to York sitting on the floor between coaches with a ton of other people in same boat. During the ride, I scoped out the surrounding coaches and found a couple of seats of people who were getting off the train in York. As soon as the train started pulling into the station, I made a break for it and scored Lee and I seats for the remaining 2.5 hours. After that, smooth sailing.

We arrived in Edinburgh at about 6:30 on Friday evening – enough time for dinner and settling in our B&B, but not much else. We stayed a little out of the city center in an area called Leith. We took a taxi there, and after a minor scare about not being able to get into the B&B since the manager was gone for the night (despite the fact that we made arrangements beforehand), we went in search of food. Our first stop was a pub pretty close to the B&B, and it was packed. We were starving and there were no tables and a ton of people, so we left... and ended up at Pizza Express. That in itself is totally lame since we have those everywhere in London, but we hadn't tried it yet and we were starving and lacking in decision-making abilities, so we had pizza. 

Saturday, we got up and had a delicious breakfast at the B&B and headed into Edinburgh to climb Arthur's Seat. Arthur's Seat is a smallish mountain/extinct volcano in the middle of Edinburgh in Hollyrood Park. It was exhausting, but beautiful. We were both a little more prepared for something on the scale of Enchanted Rock near Fredericksburg in Texas or Stone Mountain in Georgia, it was a little more difficult. Not unmanageable or anything, but just a lot more steep areas and a bit higher of a climb. The view from the top was totally worth it though.

After a quick lunch, we went to the Royal Yacht Britannia. This was the Royal family's yacht for about 50 years until it was decommissioned in 1997. I'm not a huge boat person – this was more of a Lee outing – but it was still pretty neat. The lengths they went through for privacy, cleanliness, etc were incredible.

Saturday night, Lee took me out to a nice restaurant for a kind of belated anniversary dinner. We were in such a hurry to get everything done on our actual anniversary (August 15) because we were moving the next day, that I'm pretty sure that even though we went to dinner, we spent the whole time talking about everything we still needed to do. We went to a pub/restaurant in Leith. Lee had his first draught Guinness and some grilled halibut, I had a delicious steak, and it was a good night.

Sunday, we took a little bit of a gamble. I found a well-reviewed tour on TripAdvisor that we decided to take. It was a way full day trip - we met up with the tour at 8:45am and we got back at about 6:15pm. Since it was such a beautiful day, I think we may have gotten a little bit of a different tour than they usually do, because I can't imagine climbing some of the places we did if rain was involved, but it was awesome. We left Edinburgh, stopped at the William Wallace memorial, drove through Stirling, and made a few other stops, including lunch in Aberfoyle, before heading into the highlands. This was my favorite part I think. We drove up through mountains and saw numerous beautiful lochs, and really saw some awesome sights. It was truly incredible. On the way back to Edinburgh, we stopped to feed some "hairy coos" (thats "cow" with a Scottish accent), and to walk around Doune Castle, which was used in the filming of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. Throughout the tour, our tour guide talked about Scottish history and really knew his stuff. The interesting part was that this was a "free" tour. They've made their business model a "pay what you think it's worth" kind of thing. So for this tour, they have no set prices, you just tip them at the end what you think the day was worth - which is incredible for a full day of Scottish sites and history. Definitely would recommend.

This morning, we got up and had breakfast at the B&B and headed into Edinburgh to do a little souvenir shopping and sightseeing before catching our train. So far, the way back has been much smoother. We had reserved seats - not that we needed them, this train is pretty empty. We also picked the "quiet coach" when we booked, which I am very happy about. I'm pretty sure we are the only people under 65 in here, but I'm okay with that. We are quiet and keep to ourselves, and didn't feel like repeating our trip here with the cackling ladies sitting 2 rows up.

Overall, it was excellent trip. I am looking forward to getting home to our flat and relaxing, and seeing how our cats fared without us this weekend.
