As Lee mentioned, we've got under 3 weeks until we leave. Actually, now that I think about it, 3 weeks from now I will be on a plane on my way to London - and that is the very end of the process. Crazy, right? 

We spent the last 5 days in Georgia with family. We were able to visit with my aunt and uncle on Monday and Tuesday morning, then we headed down south of Atlanta to stay with Lee's grandparents for a few days. His parents and sister joined us on Wednesday night and we got to spend a few days with everyone. We had a nice time; we mostly just hung out. 

We also read Harry Potter. Well some of it anyway. When they originally came out, I didn't read them on principle; I wasn't really interested in reading them and didn't want to do it just because everyone else was. But after more than 10 years of hearing that I really should read them, or at least see the movies, I gave in last year before the last movie came out. I spent a few weeks and read all 7 books, and then watched all of the movies. Lee loved the movies, but I've been having a heck of a time getting him to read the books. I downloaded the e-books a few weeks ago and we loaded them up on my Kindle and his iPad. Yeah, after 5 days in Georgia, he is on book 4. Too bad he never reads at home, so who knows if he will finish them.

Even though we didn't think we would be able to, we got a few more things for London nailed down while in Georgia. We received our lease for our new place on Friday morning. I've been reserving celebrating finding a place until we actually signed and returned our lease. Now I feel like I can celebrate! We spent about an hour on Friday reading the entire **30** page document and signing all **31** places required. As usual, it was full of legal speak â€“ except this time, it was all in much more proper English.  Our favorite passage of the entire thing?

> Any obligation upon the Tenant under this Agreement to do or not to do anything shall also require the Tenant not to permit or allow any licensee or visitor to do or not to do that thing.

Basically, don't do things you aren't allowed to do and don't let anyone else do them either. Why can't they just say that?

We booked movers. And I will be booking our storage space on Monday. We already know what storage location we will be using, so I will just need to go over there and set it up. We are moving out of our apartment on August 16 and then will be heading up to Dallas for a few more days with family before we leave.

We also (finally) were able to book our tickets for our moving flights. We have decided to do things a bit differently than originally planned. We will actually not be taking the same flight to get over there; Lee will be leaving on Monday, August 20 so he can get there to check into our flat on the day our lease starts. I will be staying behind for a few days to see the cats off on their flight and clean out our apartment in Austin, etc. My flight is on Saturday, August 25. 3 weeks from today.

Holy crap.
