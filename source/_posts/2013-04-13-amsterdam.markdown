{% gmap "Amsterdam" 5 right %} _Note from the Editor: It's been a long time since <del>Steph's let me</del> I've volunteered to write a blog post, so I figured I'd write about our recent visit to Amsterdam._

In the days leading up to our trip to Amsterdam, we weren't sure how well it would go; Steph kept finding places we wanted to visit that were closed (like the Rijksmuseum) or not ready for tourists (like the tulip fields).  However, we had a great time, and I'd definitely go back.

Amsterdam isn't a huge city, but Schiphol Airport is on the outskirts of town, so we took a train to get to the city center.  From there, things got interesting... Amsterdam Centraal station is fairly large and is also currently undergoing renovations, and we had the hardest time trying to figure out where we were supposed to buy transit passes for the local trams and buses (there were ticket machines _everywhere_, but they were all for the regional trains).  Steph finally found them (there were only two and I'd passed them off as ATMs), so we picked up a couple single-trip passes and caught a tram to our hotel.

{% raw %}<a class="fancybox" href="/images/blog/2013-04-13-amsterdam/DSC02306.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/2013-04-13-amsterdam/thumbnails/DSC02306.jpg" class="right"/></a>{% endraw %}The hotel was our first real introduction to Dutch residential architecture, which is to say it was our introduction to the steepest staircases we'd ever seen, much less climbed.  We later learned that at one time, buildings were taxed according to their width, so most of the older buildings are very skinny.  We were exhausted from an evening of travel and ticket frustrations, so we crashed pretty quickly.

Friday morning we picked up a couple bikes from MacBike (a local bike renter) and set out to find some breakfast.  Steph had done some research ahead of time and had already picked out several local eateries for the trip, and so despite a little trouble finding it, we ended up at a cute little cafe named Gartine.  Steph had the French toast, I had the pancakes (which were more like thick crepes), and though we weren't able to make it back, we both agreed that we could eat there every day.  We also apparently got really lucky; we were able to walk in and get a table immediately, but we took the only empty table and everybody that came in after us was told that the rest of the tables were reserved already, and some additional research afterwards showed most reviewers mentioned needing a reservation.

We spent most of the rest of the day riding our bikes around the city and visiting some touristy areas like the Bloemenmarkt and the Royal Palace.  We also took a canal cruise, which was a great way to see the city.  We finished the day with a visit to the Anne Frank House.  This was probably the most crowded touristy thing we did in Amsterdam; there was a long line to get in and then the tour was pretty much single-file through the building, and it took a while to get through it.  The house was pretty neat and the hiding place was indeed well hidden.  At the end they had in interesting installation where they were showing videos presenting modern discrimination situations, and at the end of each short clip a question about the scenario would be asked, and people in this area could vote with buttons placed around the room as to how they felt the situation should be handled; it was very interesting to see how the room voted on many of the issues presented.  Afterwards, we had dinner at a wonderful Italian restaurant just a few blocks north of there, and then rode our bikes back to the hotel.

On Saturday we took a self-guided day trip out to Edam, Volendam, and Marken.  Remember when I said Amsterdam Centraal Station was undergoing renovations?  Yeah, that included the area where we were supposed to catch our bus, and the signage in this area was exclusively in Dutch so we were a bit clueless on where to catch our bus, and so we ended up wasting about an hour before finally heading out.  Edam was a lovely area, and fairly tourist-free for a weekend day.  We toured the Edam Museum (the oldest house in Edam), the Edam City Hall, and then we bought a small wheel of cheese before heading out for Volendam.  There, we ate lunch and Steph found some fabric at a market before we caught the ferry out to Marken, which was just as quiet and charming as Edam was.  A couple travel snafus not withstanding, we had a great time exploring the Dutch countryside.

Sunday was another day filled with riding our bicycles around the city – more than 15 miles of riding (this was the day it finally dawned on me to have RunKeeper tracking our rides)!  First, we visited Vondelpark (a large city park much like Central or Hyde Park); it was beautiful, and had generously wide paths throughout for cyclists and pedestrians alike.  Next up was the Houseboat Museum (just a single houseboat turned into a small museum), then two windmills (the first being crappy enough that we sought out a better one), and then the Red-light district, which included "Our Lord in the Attic" (a hidden Catholic church), a Buddhist temple, and some awesome Thai food.  The Red-light district was interesting (to say the least), and the hidden church was actually fairly impressively hidden.

Monday was fairly low key since it was our return travel day, so we turned in our bikes that morning and visited a local market before stopping at the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch.  After that wonderfully American meal (we need one of those every now and then) we picked up our luggage from the hotel and headed back to the airport.

Side notes:

* The bicycling culture in Amsterdam is amazing!  There are cycling paths just about everywhere, and I never once felt unsafe sharing the road witch cars where we had to (and without helmets, mind you).  I really wish more cities would embrace cycling to the degree that Amsterdam has; I could really get used to it.
* As an American, you tend to grow up with certain stereotypes around native languages; natives and non-natives in America speak English, and that's what's normal.  What's mind boggling then, at least at first, is to travel somewhere in Europe where the native language isn't English, and to see/hear non-natives speaking the native language... say – for instance – Asians in the Netherlands speaking perfect Dutch.
* The above being said, it was interesting how "English-friendly" Amsterdam seemed to be; much more so than Paris was, at least.  Most of the signage in the airport and other public areas was mainly in English with some Dutch subtext, which was very helpful.
