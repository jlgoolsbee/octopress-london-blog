Nineteen days.  Give or take a day perhaps since we haven't nailed down our final move plans yet (which sounds crazy as I type it now), but a little under 3 weeks isn't a lot of time!  And there's so much to do; mostly packing, but there's also a large (and growing) pile of stuff to take to Goodwill, plus getting a storage space, hiring movers, selling both of our cars, and about twenty other things.  Oh, and figuring out our final move plans!

We're in Georgia this week visiting with relatives before the move.  My grandparents live about an hour south of Atlanta, and Stephanie has an aunt and uncle that live just north of Atlanta.  In some ways we really needed this trip to help calm us down ahead of the move, and in other ways we're just constantly thinking about the things we have to do at home.  Hopefully the calm takes precedence in the end.

Stephanie shared with y'all that we'd found a place to live in London, but she didn't include any pictures... shame on her.

It really is an awesome flat; as Stephanie said the pictures really don't do it justice (partially because the pictures from the leasing website are fairly low-res, and partially because it is that nice a flat), and it really is exactly what we were looking for.  I also loved the poetic-ness of the landlords moving to Canada, basically trading continents with us.

We haven't really talked much about our faith on this blog, but is has been amazing for both of us to see how faithful God has been and continues to be during this process.  Throughout our planning and preparations for the move, one thing that has been impressed upon both of us time and time again is that God has a plan greater than what we can see or even imagine, and He will be faithful to it.  **So many things** that’ve had the opportunity to go wrong haven't, and so many times we've been worried about something, He’s shown us that in the end, He knows what's best and is right there with us in all of this.

And that's pretty comforting right about now.
