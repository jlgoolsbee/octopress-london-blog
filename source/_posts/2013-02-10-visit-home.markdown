We had a really great time, but I think we were both ready to get back to real life.

We spent the first few days of our visit staying with Lee's family. We were able to celebrate Lee's birthday with them, and have our Christmas, and mostly just hang out. It was really nice to actually have time to just relax together.

The next few days we spent staying with Lee's brother Andrew in Austin. Lee was able to spend a couple of days working in the Austin office, and I took the opportunity to relax... and shop... I know Lee enjoyed getting to spend some time with his brother, plus we got to eat at some of our favorite restaurants (not ashamed to admit we pretty much planned the trip around food).

We spent the last week at my parents house. Since our families live so close, we did a fair amount of shuffling back and forth the whole trip which was nice. We didn't really do anything major. I got to hang out with my mom, have dinner with my dad, go get pedicures and lunch with my grandma Mimi, and spend some time with my sisters.

Overall, it was a very nice visit and we were able to see almost everyone we wanted to see. Our next visit is in June and will probably be much shorter, because we are coming mostly for a couple specific events, but we are looking forward to it already.
