Hey there; my name is Lee.  You already know my wife Stephanie at this point as she's already written a few posts (and we haven't even started publishing this thing yet)!  I figure I should probably introduce myself and write something, so here goes.

Working internationally is something my wife and I had talked about long ago.  She studied abroad in Spain during the summer between her sophomore and junior years of college and loved the experience, and I've never been to Europe and have always wanted to go, so we decided a long time a go that we'd consider working abroad if ever given the opportunity.  Fast-forward a couple years, and here we are, on the precipice of doing just that.

The place – as you may have figured by now – is London, England.  The plan as it stands is for us to be over there for at least a year, at which point we'll reevaluate things, and eventually we'll move back, likely to the Austin area.  We'll use this blog to let our family and friends know how we're doing, and you're welcome to join in and read about our experiences.  Enjoy!
