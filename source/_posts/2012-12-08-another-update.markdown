This is a very long catch up post. I have to get better about not doing that. Since we've last updated, our cat broke his hip and had to have surgery, my parents came to visit, we had our first holiday away from our families, and we've spent several weekends visiting areas in and around London.

## Reg's surgery

{% raw %}<a class="fancybox" href="/images/blog/2012-12-08-another-update/IMG_9883.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/2012-12-08-another-update/thumbnails/IMG_9883.jpg" class="right"/></a>{% endraw %}A little over a month ago, Reginald (our male cat) started limping a little. Reg and Romona rough-house quite a bit – Romona is a big bully even though she is roughly half his size – so we just figured he pulled something (as has happened before) and we gave him a couple of days to feel better... except it didn't get better, it got a whole lot worse. So, I took him in to the vet and they did an x-ray and determined he basically broke the top of his leg where it connects to his hip joint, and they scheduled him for surgery to remove the broken fragment the same day. Since they are inside-only cats and our flat is tiny, we only have guesses as to how he did it, but it was so sad. I have never had a pet of my own before, so I've never had an injured pet before, and it was just terrible to watch. It was also pretty terrible actually getting him to and from the vet. Since we hadn't needed to take them anywhere yet, the only carriers we had were the giant ones that are required by the airlines for international air travel, and we don't have a car. I thought I'd be fine taking the bus, but it was awful. Heavy cat in heavy box. Never again. I took a cab home, which was less painful for all involved. Reg seems to be doing much better. His fur is growing back pretty well (they shaved half his back for the surgery), and we have had two check-ups and they seem confident he will heal fully, but his gait may always be a little different. 

## Our first visitors

My parents were here for a week in November. We had a good time but it was a lot busier than I think any of us planned on. Lee and I learned a lot about having visitors, so that was good. We hit all the well known places – Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, Tower of London, etc – as well as some others like Windsor Castle (just outside of London) for the Changing of the Guard and Greenwich to see the Prime Meridian line. We ate in Chinatown for my mom's birthday and we went to see Jersey Boys which was great. We also avoided the Twilight premiere happening about 100 yards from where we were. We saw a big screen playing the trailer, lots of lights, and hundreds of screaming girls, and we ran the other direction. It was really great to get to spend some time with my parents and show them around where we live now.

## Thanksgiving

{% raw %}<a class="fancybox" href="/images/blog/2012-12-08-another-update/IMG_9899.jpg"><img src="/images/blog/2012-12-08-another-update/thumbnails/IMG_9899.jpg" class="right"/></a>{% endraw %}Lee and I had our first major holiday without our families for the first time ever. Even though Thanksgiving isn't a holiday here (for obvious reasons), I was able to find stuff to make a nice dinner for us with an abbreviated menu. We still had plenty of food for a nice big dinner on Thanksgiving and a couple small leftover meals. It was great. Lee had to work on Thursday, so I spent most of the day at home cooking, but he worked from home on Friday, so we got our nice relaxing pajama day that my family enjoys so much around holidays.

## Dover

Last weekend on a whim, Lee and I decided we wanted to get out of town, so we took a train down to Dover for the day on Sunday. We ended up on a high speed train both ways so it only took us about an hour each way from central London. We got to Dover right at 10am, and spent several hours walking around Dover Castle. After we were done at the castle, we got directions to walk over the White Cliffs for some more sightseeing. The directions we got were terrible. We asked the woman at the pedestrian exit if we could walk or if we should try and get a taxi. She acted like we were crazy for wanting a taxi – "oh, just take a right, and then the second right, and then they are right there!" So we took off walking. Up a giant hill. And then we made the second right turn and ended up on a two lane highway with no sidewalks. But by that point we were in the middle of nowhere with no chance of getting a taxi and had already put so much effort into getting there... all told it was about 1.5 miles, which really isn't that far, but the terrain wasn't excellent. We eventually made it and still had a while to walk the paths along the cliffs and take some great pictures. It was a beautifully clear day – we could see all the way to France – but it was freaking freezing. I'm not sure it got above freezing all day. It was definitely an adventure, but we had a great day.

## Our lives

I've really picked up my cooking in the last month or so. We have had an app on the iPad ([Paprika][3], for those interested) for a while that I started using in Austin to organize some of my recipes. That worked okay in Austin, but these days since I'm not working, I do the menu planning and grocery shopping while Lee has the iPad at work, so I wasn't being adventurous in my cooking at all. I noticed a few weeks ago that I had gotten in a bad habit of just bookmarking the recipes I want to try and then never doing anything with them. So I got the same app for my computer and started going through and adding all of the recipes I thought I'd like to try. It's been working great! I have been making 2-3 new recipes a week (not all full meals - some side dishes also) and we have been really happy with the results, and the variety! Just about every time I cook, Lee comments about how good of a cook I am becoming and that is great for my confidence. :)

I think we are settling in here nicely. I think we both go back and forth on a daily basis about our lives here and how long we would like to stay. I think the only thing we agree on completely now is that a year isn't long enough, so hopefully that gets extended. I am still on the fence about getting a job, but I've started looking, just not very seriously yet. Since I would need to be off for 2-3 weeks in January for our trip home, it seems like a silly time to get hired somewhere. We also really need to do some more traveling. I'd like to get another weekend trip in before the end of the year; I'm not sure how practical that goal is, but we will see.

We put up a Christmas tree (or shrubbery as we call it) in our flat, and I've been been working on some sewing projects to finish our decorations. I am 80% done with stockings, and I have some great fabric to make a tree skirt. It is definitely going to be a strange Christmas for us for many reasons: we will be alone for the first time ever, we are on a completely different continent, and we aren't really planning to exchange gifts since we have a couple of bigger purchases we are planning to make. I am, however, looking forward to making some of our own traditions. And having an extra 3 weeks to buy Christmas gifts for our families, because I have zero ideas.

We are also looking forward to our trip back to Texas in January. We will be there for about 2 weeks and we'll get to spend time in DFW and Austin. It should be awesome.
