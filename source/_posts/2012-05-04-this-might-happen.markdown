Well, it's been an interesting couple of weeks.  

First of all, my parents officially (it’s been in progress for a while) moved out of the house they’ve lived in for the last 11 years last week. It wasn’t my childhood home, but it was my home. It was the last place I lived with my family before going to college and getting married and all. I got a little homesick, so Lee took me to DFW last weekend to visit with our families.  We even got to be the first house-guests at the new house. :) 

While we were at home, we took the opportunity to talk to our families about the possibility of the London situation.  It went way better/different than we anticipated. We are so blessed to have such supportive parents. 

That being said, I am super glad we were able to go home last weekend and talk to our parents about the possibility.  Because on Thursday of this week, Lee was actually given some specifics. This means that we can actually start this process. We can actually start taking some of the hypotheticals and making them real.  This is really exciting. And really scary. 

So basically, we are not yet committed to anything. We have an unofficial offer, and we get to do research and crunch numbers and think about timing and figure out what is best for us. A daunting task.

This may actually happen. Oh my gosh.
